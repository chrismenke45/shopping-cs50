This is some practice with uncertainty estimating for [CS50's Shopping](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/4/shopping/). I wrote the load_data, train_model and evaluate functions. 
- load_data loads website traffic data from a csv 
- train_model adds the website data to a scikit-learn  KNeighborsClassifier model
- evaluate checks some test data to see how well the model predicts someone's likelyhood of buying from the site

It was great to use scikit-learn to train some AI. It was super quick to set up and I'll likely use it in the future if I have enough data to train a model.
